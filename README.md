<p id="description">This project implements a real-time fire detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model trained on custom-labeled fire images. The model is tested on live fire scenarios to ensure accurate detection.</p>

  
  
<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   **Real-Time Fire Detection** – Detects fire in live video streams using a pre-trained YOLO model.
*   **Custom Trained Model** – Uses a fine-tuned YOLO model trained on a labeled fire dataset for better accuracy.
*   **Multiple Input Sources** – Supports video files (BonFireVideo.mp4) webcams and image inputs for fire detection.
*   **Frame-by-Frame Processing** – Processes each frame efficiently highlighting detected fire regions with bounding boxes.
*   **Optimized for Speed** – Leverages YOLO’s fast inference time to achieve real-time performance.
*   **Custom Dataset Support** – Allows training on new fire datasets to improve accuracy for different fire conditions.
*   **Scalable Deployment** – Can be extended for industrial fire monitoring CCTV surveillance or drone-based fire detection.
*   **Easy-to-Use Interface** – Simple script execution with command-line arguments for flexibility in detection settings.
*   **Lightweight and Efficient** – Works on standard hardware without requiring a high-end GPU.
*   **Logging and Alert System (Future Scope)** – Can be extended to log fire occurrences and send alerts via email or SMS.
